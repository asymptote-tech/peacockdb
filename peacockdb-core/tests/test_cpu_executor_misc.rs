/// missing file, on the GPU host, long after the change.

/// **Its execution.** `CpuBackend` is a working backend: a case that drove it would not
/// fail at all. It would produce a whole tree of plausible microseconds measured on the
/// wrong machine, and nothing downstream — not the record, not a plot — carries a field
/// that says which backend ran. That is worse than a missing file, and
/// it is why the two names sit in one list.
///
/// Deliberately NOT `CpuBatch`: it lives on the GPU path legitimately, because an unload

/// person to edit this list instead of their change.

/// Checked here, in the CPU tier, on a machine with no GPU, at the moment the call is
/// added — rather than as a device failure hours later.

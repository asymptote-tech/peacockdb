//! Benchmark run over the batch-partitioned corpus: every query
//! [`corpus_benchmark_cases.inc`](common/corpus_benchmark_cases.inc) names, at the modes
//! it names. Asserts nothing about an answer — correctness is `test_gpu_bp_corpus`.
//!
//! NOT run by CI (`INTENTIONALLY_NOT_IN_CI` says why): it needs a GPU, takes tens of
//! minutes, and measures rather than gates. `build-test-shadgpu.sh --build-benchmarks`
//! and `--run-benchmarks` build it under `[profile.benchmarks]` and run it; on the host
//! directly it is `--nocapture --test-threads=1`, and the threads are not optional —
//! cuDF/RMM share one process-wide pool.

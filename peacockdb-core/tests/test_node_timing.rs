//! Does the instrument change what it measures, and does it measure what it claims?
//!
//! Every record under `testdata/benchmark-results/` assumes a node's reported time is
//! the time it would have taken unobserved. Events record without draining the stream,
//! so they can satisfy that — whether they do is measured here rather than assumed.
//!
//! One query, because this is about the instrument and not the corpus:
//!   1. Is `Off` actually off?
//!   2. Does `Events` cost anything measurable? (the assertion)
//!   3. Do the events land where they claim?

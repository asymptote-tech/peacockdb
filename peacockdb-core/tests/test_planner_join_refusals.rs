//! Every shape the planner refuses, from the sql that reaches it.

//! in a comment beside it: the message is what a user sees when a query does not plan.
//!
//! Three refusals are missing here on purpose — a final aggregate with no partial below
//! it, a repartition by an unstated rule, and an empty IN list. No query produces any of
//! them, so they are hand-built in `test_planner_join_capability.rs` and carry no ticket:
//! they are internal-consistency guards rather than limitations.

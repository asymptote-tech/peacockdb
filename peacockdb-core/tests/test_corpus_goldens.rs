//! What proves the corpus infra, since every way it fails is quiet.
//!
//! A dropped section, a filtered regeneration that deletes coverage, a marker a reader
//! cannot tell from an absence — none of these turn a run red on their own. So each has a
//! case here, built from strings and temporary files rather than by editing a committed
//! golden and undoing it, and every one is deterministic: this tier's whole claim is that a
//! golden means something, and a case that passes on the third run is a golden that means
//! nothing.
//!
//! The second half reads the committed corpus goldens back and checks them against their
//! own redundancy. The cost tree has no external oracle — the golden is written by the run
//! that will later check it — but a file that contradicts itself is a file the renderer got
//! wrong, and the renderer is most of what could be wrong.

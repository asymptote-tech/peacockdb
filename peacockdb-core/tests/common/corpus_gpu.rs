//! One corpus query at one mode, on the device.
//!
//! The device side reads what the CPU side wrote and never writes: per-node shape and
//! statistics against that mode's `.cpu.txt` always, and the result where the declaration
//! names a golden. It ignores the regeneration variables rather than honouring them — a
//! device that can author its own golden proves nothing against it.
//!
//! What the tree assertion is worth is worth stating: `run` is generic
//! over the backend, so both engines walk one driver over one plan and produce the same
//! shape by construction. The evidence is the rows and the bytes under it. The shape check
//! stays because it costs nothing and goes red on the day that construction stops holding.

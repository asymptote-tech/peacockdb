# peacockdb cost-model calibration record. One row per CALL — per
# (plan node, recipe step, call index), not per node and not per output partition: one
#   plan node publishes several recipe steps, and a batched run drives each of them once
#   per batch per lane. A call answering with several output partitions is still ONE row;
#   its cost is the sum over its regions, because the shared prologue is charged to p0.
# A benchmark executes its plan several times and writes EVERY measured execution, in
#   the order they ran; the .benchmark.txt beside it reports one chosen run instead. So
#   the same (query, mode, node_seq, recipe_seq, call_index) recurs once per execution,
#   told apart by run_index. Spread across executions is data.
# ONE FILE IS ONE RUN. The `# run:` lines below hold what is constant across it, and
#   each of them changes what the microseconds MEAN — so appending a run that disagrees
#   with them is refused rather than merged.
# mode = the batch-partitioned planning mode, `bp-tp4-sized` and the like. The same query
#   at two modes is a different plan and a different set of calls.
# node_seq = the node's position in the TREE, post-order — the same space recipe_seq is
#   in. The driver numbers nodes pre-order, so this is a translation and not the index a
#   report is walked by.
# lane = the lane the node was DRIVEN on. A scatter is driven on one and emits into four,
#   a cross-lane accumulator the other way round; a call belongs to the driving one.
# recipe_seq = the seq the call addressed in the FlatBuffers plan. Deliberately a different
#   index from node_seq: one plan node with two calls is one tree position and two fb ones.
# recipe_kind = the fb node kind the call addressed, `CudfAggregate{Partial}` and the
#   like. Redundant with recipe_seq given the plan, and written anyway so a row is
#   readable without one.
# call_index = which call of this recipe_seq the session had reached, 0 for the first.
#   The number C++ counts to independently, and the key the two halves of a measurement
#   meet on.
# run_index = which execution of the case, 0 for the first MEASURED one — the warm-up is
#   not written. Derivable from a repeat of call_index 0 and written anyway, so that a
#   file joined against this one (hbm.tsv) names the same execution by the same number
#   rather than by its own count of the same boundary.
# out_rows/out_bytes = what the call answered with, summed over its output partitions.
#   Both come from the device's region: a call in the middle of a node's chain hands the
#   raw handle on, so this side never built a batch from it and never priced it.
# in_rows/in_bytes = what the CALLER handed over, summed over the call's input slots.
#   Empty where the input was the previous call's output: nothing on this side priced it,
#   and that call's own out_bytes is the figure.
# peacock_host_us = host time before the region's first device touch — the prologue only
#   peacockdb pays.
# cudf_host_us = host time from that touch to the end of the region. NOT launch cost:
#   cuDF and rmm synchronize internally, so it follows device_us closely.
# device_us = between the region's CUDA events, on the one stream everything is issued
#   to. An interval of that stream, not a figure for the device as a whole.
# hbm_bytes is NOT here: it comes from Nsight and joins on the same tuple.";

// ── the accounting, on a real plan ──────────────────────────────────────────

// The budget path, on a query rather than on a mock.
//
// Eight `Executor` impls report a residency and a transient, and until this ran on a real
// plan the only things reading them were two unit cases: every end-to-end run above
// passes `None`, which is the accountant watching rather than enforcing.
//
// The budget is searched for rather than taken from the watching run's peak, and the
// reason is the finding: a pre-call check tests the MODELLED transient, which can exceed
// what the run was ever observed holding — this query peaks at 8,222 bytes and the
// smallest budget it fits in is 9,556, which is what its nested-loop join asks for before
// a call. A budget equal to the observed peak therefore trips, which is the accounting
// working rather than failing.
//
// So the claim is that a boundary exists and is one byte wide: the smallest budget that
// completes, and the byte below it that does not.
/// Ignored under [#182](../../llm-wiki/tasks/active-tickets.md) rather than deleted, so it stays
/// compiled and listed: pricing a `CpuBatch` from the plan's schema moved the accounting under
/// it and the budget stopped being a boundary. The bar for T18 is results and node stats
/// consistent between the engines; memory accounting is deferred.

// enforces, and the two rewrites reach it by different halves: a drained lane moves row
// groups between lanes, a rebatcher moves the batch sizes the accountant prices.
// `q16` at four lanes peaks at 104.7 MB as planned and 77.9 MB with lane 0 drained, and
// its budget follows, 131.5 MB against 104.7 MB. `nested-loop-join` at tp4-rowgroup
// peaks at 8,222 bytes and 8,540 under a rebatcher, and its budget does not move: the
// pre-call check tests the join's own transient, which merging a lane's batches leaves
// alone.
/// Ignored under [#182](../../llm-wiki/tasks/active-tickets.md), the same change: the peak stopped
/// depending on the batch shape, since logical bytes are a function of rows and var-length
/// content alone, so `rebatch=sources` moves nothing and this case's premise is gone. Whether a
/// peak that ignores batch shape is right is the ticket's question.

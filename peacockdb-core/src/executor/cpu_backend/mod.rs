//! The CPU backend's executors: one DataFusion operator per node, run one batch at a time.
//!
//! The operator is built at construction and the batch is what changes per call, so what
//! a call does is hand [`execute_single_node`] one node and the rows it runs over.
//!
//! The traits are synchronous and DataFusion's operator API is not, so each call blocks a
//! thread on one node's stream. A sort past its in-place threshold spawns onto the runtime
//! from under that block, which is what a driver has to leave room for (T17).

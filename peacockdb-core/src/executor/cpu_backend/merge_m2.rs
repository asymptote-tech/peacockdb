//! `merge_m2`: state into state, which none of DataFusion's aggregate modes does.
//!
//! Partial takes values and emits state, Final takes state and emits a value, Single does
//! both at once. The engine stacks two merges — per lane, then across lanes — so the lower
//! one must emit the state the upper one reads. It is the gap `AggregateMode::Merge` was
//! added to the wire to fill.
//!
//! The accumulator is DataFusion's own with one method rewired: what arrives is state, so
//! `update_batch` merges it. No part of Welford is written out here, because the device
//! runs cuDF's MERGE_M2 and two spellings differ in the last digits.

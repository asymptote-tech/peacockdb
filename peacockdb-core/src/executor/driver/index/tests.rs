//! What the index derives, against a plan whose shape is written down here.
//!
//! Every one of these is read far from where it is computed — a subtree range decides
//! which nodes a join holds, `ready_lanes` decides when a cross-lane node is runnable, and
//! `slot_base` decides whose residency a call is charged to — so a wrong one shows as a
//! deadlock or a mis-billed byte rather than as a wrong index.

//! Which node runs next: smallest height among the runnable, ties leftmost.
//!
//! Maintained incrementally rather than rescanned. The predicate the prototype evaluates
//! per step — every node, every lane, and both hold chains to the root — is
//! O(nodes × lanes × depth) in front of work that is O(lanes) executor calls. Here each
//! event that can change an answer updates the one node it touches, and a pick is a scan
//! for the lowest set bit of a bitset ordered by (height, order).
//!
//! Nothing here knows about backends, batches or executors: it takes events and returns a
//! node. That is what makes a scheduling corner reachable from a test that builds no plan.

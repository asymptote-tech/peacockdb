//! Layout injection: rewriting a planned tree into shapes no planner would emit, and
//! demanding the same rows out of every one of them.
//!
//! Two rewrites and two wraps. A rebatcher and a drained lane change the tree — one
//! inserts a node, the other moves a lane's row groups to its neighbour — and are built on
//! [`rebuild`](super::rebuild::rebuild). Zero-row batches and a degenerate hash are
//! behaviour no node carries, so they wrap the source and emit executors of a backend
//! otherwise the CPU one. Lane counts are deliberately absent: `target_partitions` varies
//! them through the planner already.

//! The corpus goldens: where they live, how a case reads one section, and how a
//! regenerating case writes one without losing the others.
//!
//! One file per mode holds every query, so several test cases write one path. A whole-file
//! write would be last-writer-wins — every other query's section dropped, and the run
//! green. So a write takes an advisory lock on the file, merges its own section into what
//! is there, and publishes by renaming a sibling onto the name.

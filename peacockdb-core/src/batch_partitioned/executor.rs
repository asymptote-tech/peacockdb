//! The executor contracts, one per node category.
//!
//! Every state transition emits in the same call, so there is no wrong interleaving to
//! construct and output timing is a pure function of the call sequence. Every method
//! that ends a protocol consumes `self`, which makes four run-time guards the prototype
//! needed into compile errors: probing before `set_build`, a second `set_build`, probing
//! after `finish_and_fetch`, and accumulating after `mark_done_and_fetch`. The source's
//! consuming step removes a fifth — the driver's own exhaustion flag.

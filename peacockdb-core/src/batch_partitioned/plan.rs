//! Planning a query in this mode: DataFusion's physical plan in, a node tree and its
//! memory model out.
//!
//! Two passes, because the two halves define each other — a batch size needs the tree it
//! flows through, and the tree's mapping needs a batch size. The first pass assumes one
//! number for every source and is used only to derive the real ones; the second is the
//! plan. The tree's shape does not move between them: lane counts come from row counts
//! and pushed-down limits, never from the batch size.

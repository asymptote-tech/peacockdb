//! The GPU backend's executors: a node's recipe is the instruction set, and running it is
//! all these do.
//!
//! Nothing here builds a cuDF call of its own, deliberately: the recipe already says which
//! seqs to address and in what order, so an executor that also built calls would be a
//! second path to the same kernels, and the two would drift where the plan golden pins
//! only the recipe.
//!
//! So an executor holds a borrowed session pointer, its recipe's calls, and the schema its
//! output is priced by. Handles thread from one call to the next.

//! The GPU backend's executors: a node's recipe is the instruction set, and running it is
//! all these do.
//!
//! No legacy operator code is reached from here, deliberately: the recipe already says
//! which seqs to address and in what order, so an executor that also built cuDF calls
//! would be a second path to the same kernels, and the two would drift where the plan
//! golden pins only the recipe.
//!
//! So an executor holds a borrowed session pointer, its recipe's calls, and the schema its
//! output is priced by. Handles thread from one call to the next.

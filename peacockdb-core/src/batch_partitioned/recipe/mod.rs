//! The recipe plan: the buffer the C++ is handed, and per node the ABI calls it drives.
//!
//! The C++ side never sees this mode's tree. It is sent a plan in the legacy vocabulary
//! whose nodes exist to be addressed — a menu of parameterized kernels — and the driver
//! then calls the ABI as often as its own schedule wants. One walk builds that buffer and
//! records, per plan node, the calls it makes and the seqs they address;
//! `llm-wiki/tasks/batch_partitioned_executor.md` has the table it implements.
//!
//! A node that makes no ABI call gets no recipe, and the absence is a statement about the
//! node rather than a gap: a forwarder routes batches and touches no device.

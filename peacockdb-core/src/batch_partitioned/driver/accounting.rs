//! resident = Σ byte_size of driver-held in-flight batches
//!          + Σ cached resident_bytes() over live executors
//! ```
//!
//! The executor half is cached per slot and refreshed one instance at a time. That is not

//! holding a reference to each, and the driver owns them mutably. A refresh takes the
//! figure after the call, never a handle to what produced it.

//! The two drivers, the schedule they follow, and the accounting they fail a query on.
//!
//! [`partitioned`] owns the tree, the queues, the schedule and the three cross-lane
//! categories; [`single_partition`] is one lane of one lane-scoped node, deciding which
//! call that lane's input state calls for and making exactly one. Both are generic over
//! [`Backend`](super::backend::Backend), so each backend monomorphizes and nothing on the
//! per-batch path is boxed. The reasons are `llm-wiki/architecture.md`, under Execution.

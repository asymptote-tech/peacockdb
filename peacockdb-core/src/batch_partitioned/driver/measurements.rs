//! Joining the two halves of a measurement: what this side recorded per call, and what the
//! device reported per region.
//!
//! Neither half is a measurement on its own. The driver knows WHERE a call was — which
//! node, which lane, which batch — and the device knows WHAT it cost and what it produced.
//! They meet on `(seq, call_index)`, a key both sides count to independently and in the
//! same order.
//!
//! What comes out is a [`Measured`] per call, and the module is named for that rather than
//! for time: the output of a call in the middle of a node's chain is reported here and
//! nowhere else, because nothing on this side ever built a batch from it.

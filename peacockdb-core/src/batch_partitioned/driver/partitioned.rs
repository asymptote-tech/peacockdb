//! `batch_partitioned_driver` — the tree, the queues, the schedule, and everything

//! One step runs every lane of the node the schedule picked: smallest height, ties
//! leftmost. That single rule is what makes this a push model — a batch's parent is
//! strictly lower, so it is carried up before anything below produces again — and what
//! bounds every queue at one batch per lane without a cap. Lane-scoped work is delegated
//! to [`super::single_partition`]; the three cross-lane categories are here, along with
//! the one node the driver special-cases, a `GpuUnload` carrying a limit.

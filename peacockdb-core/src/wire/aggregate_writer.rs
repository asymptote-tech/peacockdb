//! The aggregate payload, which is the one kind whose vocabulary differs on the two
//! sides.
//!
//! We declare aggregators — `count`, `mean`, `m2`, `merge_m2` — and the wire declares SQL
//! aggregates plus a mode, leaving the state layout to the executor. Four of ours map by
//! name; the Welford triple does not, since no `m2` name exists there. It is rebuilt into
//! the one SQL aggregate it decomposes, which is what the schema's `agg_state`
//! annotations are for: they say which output columns belong to which aggregate, and with
//! what `ddof`. The same reconstruction serves the merge, where `merge_m2` is one call
//! against three state columns and the wire spells it as the SQL aggregate plus `Merge`.

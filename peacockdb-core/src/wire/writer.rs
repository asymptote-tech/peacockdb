//! The walk that builds the recipe plan's bytes, and with them the seq numbers.
//!
//! A seq is a post-order index into the tree the C++ indexes, so it cannot be counted
//! from the recipes alone: whatever fills a structural slot is indexed too. Hence one
//! walk that builds the buffer and numbers as it goes. Three rules keep the order it
//! creates nodes in equal to the order `NodeSession::index_post_order` visits them, and
//! each is stated where it is applied — [`Writer::take`], [`Writer::stub`] and
//! [`Writer::reduce`]. Nothing addresses a stub or a structural union: they hold the tree
//! together, and the seqs a recipe publishes point at the nodes that carry a call.

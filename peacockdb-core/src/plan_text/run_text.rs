//! The execution golden's text: the plan tree, and what the run produced at each node.
//!
//! The node line is the plan golden's minus the declared schema — a plan fact, recorded
//! once beside the plan — plus the two totals both mode families carry. Under it goes one
//! line holding what the node consumed and the size of every batch it emitted.
//!
//! Its tests are the driver's, in `driver/tests/render.rs`: rendering a report takes a run,
//! and the mock backend that makes one deterministic lives there.
//!
//! The tree is walked through the driver's own [`PlanIndex`], not through a second walk of
//! the same shape: the report is addressed by that index, and two walks agreeing is a
//! coincidence to be avoided rather than relied on.

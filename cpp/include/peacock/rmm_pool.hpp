// Pooled device allocator: the sizing rule, and the one function that installs it.
//
// cuDF allocates every intermediate through rmm's current device resource, and rmm's
// default is a bare cudaMalloc/cudaFree per allocation. A query that materializes dozens of
// multi-GiB intermediates therefore pays a driver round trip — and on a unified-memory part
// a page-table walk and a zeroing pass — per intermediate. That is not background noise:
// on GB10, TPC-H q1 over the whole table measured 76.5 s without a pool.
//
// This header lives under `cpp/include/` rather than `cpp/tests/` because three different
// callers install the same pool and must not drift:
//   - the single-GPU gtest binaries, from their main();
//   - `peacock_install_rmm_pool` in the FFI, so a Rust caller — which cannot include a
//     C++ header — gets the same allocator the gtest binaries have. Without it two
//     families of numbers are taken under different allocators and quietly compared
//     (llm-wiki/archive/archived-tickets.md #151);
//   - `multi_gpu.cpp` keeps its own per-device installation, because a pool per worker
//     thread on the device that worker owns is a different lifecycle, but reads the
//     percentages from here.
//
// The engine still does not install this on its own behalf: no path under `cpp/src/` calls
// it except the FFI entry point above, which nothing in this workspace invokes today. So
// a shipping query still allocates the expensive way, and `gpu_memory_limit` is still
// accepted and ignored. That is #148, deliberately left open here: making the engine
// self-install changes where every shipping query's memory comes from and what
// `gpu_memory_limit` means, which is a decision about the product, not about measurement.

"""Draw the calibration record, before anything is derived from it.

THE one script. Every picture under `plots/`, and the `index.html` that shows them on one
page, comes from this call and from nothing else. That is the point rather than a tidiness
preference: a second generator is a second reading of the format, and two readings of one
file disagree the first time a column moves.

A number per call answers "how much"; it cannot answer "is this the right shape", because
it comes out the same either way. These are the pictures that say whether a call's cost is
describable at all, so nothing here reduces a call to one number before it is drawn --
every measured execution is a point.

Not matplotlib's default python: this repo's `python3` is a linuxbrew build with neither
numpy nor matplotlib. `/usr/bin/python3` has both.

WHAT IS DRAWN

  load/     the SCAN, alone. `CudfScan` is storage and PCIe; everything else is compute.
            See "load is not processing" below -- this separation is the reason the
            directory exists rather than a panel inside `compute/`.
  compute/  per cuDF step kind: device_us against out_bytes and in_bytes, log-log, one
            point per execution. The shape the cost model assumes is a straight line
            through the origin; a per-kind panel is where it either looks like one or
            does not.
  spread/   per step kind: every execution's device_us as a ratio to that call's median
            across executions. Any single figure for a call collapses them, and this is
            the plot that says what that discards.
  query/    per (query, mode): where the time went, by node and by term.
  hbm/      hbm_bytes against out_bytes, where an HBM capture was joined in.
  icicle/   per (query, mode): plan node -> recipe step -> cuDF call, width in device
            microseconds. The record's three-level tuple, drawn as the three levels it is.

LOAD IS NOT PROCESSING

A scan at sf40 is most of the query and is entirely `read_parquet`: decompression, page
decode, PCIe. A filter is arithmetic over resident columns. Putting both on one axis
draws one picture about two different machines -- one bounded by storage, the other by
compute -- and a line through the pair describes neither. So no panel here mixes them,
and every panel says which of the two it is.

READING THE RECORD

The parser is this file's own. The record's columns are read here and nowhere else, so a
column that moves breaks one reader loudly rather than two readers differently.

Everything is read BY COLUMN NAME. The record's columns have already changed twice, and a
reader that counts fields survives such a change quietly, drawing whatever slid into the
slot it wanted.

    the reason the record carries a tuple at all, so a panel drawing both is the one
    picture that proves it works — see the key below for what the join may and may not
    carry across the two runs.

    An hbm row with no matching record row is not dropped quietly. The two files come
    from different runs of the same cases, so a miss means they are not the same cases —
    a filter that differed, a capture from before a rename — and a plot silently drawn
    from the half that matched would look exactly like a complete one.

    Calls under ten metric samples are drawn hollow. The integral over a call shorter
    than the sampling period is an estimate from too few points, and a reader who cannot
    see which points those are will fit a line through them.

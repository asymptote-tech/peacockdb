"""Minimal stdlib test harness, so a test file runs with plain `python <file>`.

These scripts have no project dependencies and the system python here has no pytest, so
the two things this suite actually uses from pytest — a `raises` context manager and a
runner — live here instead. Under pytest only `raises` is used, and it behaves the same,
so both entry points run the identical tests. A copy of scripts/exec_model/tests/harness.py:
the two suites share no code and neither imports the other.

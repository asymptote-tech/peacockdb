"""What a timed region spends its time on, one level down, from an Nsight capture.

        ./scripts/build-test-shadgpu.sh --run-benchmarks --pull-benchmarks

        --out testdata/calibration/calls.tsv \
        --plans testdata/goldens/tpch.sf40/bp-tp1-single.plans.txt

Which query a region belongs to is READ OFF THE CAPTURE: the harness wraps each case in an
NVTX range naming it, so nothing has to be told on the command line. `--plans` is still a
path because the goldens live where they live, and its mode selects which of the capture's
cases it can check.

The calibration record has one number per region and one input size for it. For a hash
join that input size is the SUM over both children -- `input_for` adds every child's
bytes together -- and a join's cost does not depend on its two sides the same way, so
that sum cannot explain it. This reads the split back out of a
capture instead of adding columns to the record: libcudf pushes an NVTX range around
every public call it makes, so the build side (`hash_join`), the probe (`inner_join`) and
the materialisation (`gather`) are already three separate spans inside our region. The
engine is not touched, and neither is the format.

WHAT A ROW IS

One row per (node_seq, call, depth), aggregated over the executions in the capture. The
region is the `p<k>` range our own domain pushes per output partition; `depth` is how
deep the call sits inside it among calls of the same domain, so **depth 0 rows partition
the region and deeper rows break those down**. Summing across depths double-counts.

Every region also gets a `(unattributed)` row at depth 0: the part of it that is inside
no call of the traced domain at all. Without it a reader has no way to tell a region
explained by its calls from one where they cover a third of the span, and the second is
the interesting case -- it means the cost is in our code, not in cuDF's.

HOST AND DEVICE ARE DIFFERENT COLUMNS

`host_us` is the NVTX range itself: the wall time the calling thread spent inside that
cuDF call. `device_us` is the sum of kernel, memcpy and memset durations whose launching
runtime call falls inside the range, joined through CUPTI's correlationId.

The two are not the same measurement and neither replaces the other. A cuDF call that
submits asynchronously and returns has a small host span and a large device one; a call
that synchronizes has host >= device. And `device_us` is a SUM over device operations,
not a union of their spans -- concurrent work on several streams is counted once per
operation. It answers "how much device work did this call cause", not "how long was the
device busy".

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE

A capture is not a measurement of the unprofiled run. nsys serializes some of what it
traces, and the .benchmark.txt written by a captured run is not comparable with any
other -- which is why the capture is a knob and not part of the ordinary run.

Threads other than the one that pushed the region are not attributed to it: a device
operation launched from a pool thread lands in the `(off-thread)` tally printed at the
end rather than in a region. For the single-threaded execute path that tally should be
the parquet reader's and nothing else.

    Attributing at the launch site and not at the kernel's own timestamps is the only
    choice that stays true for asynchronous work: the kernel a call submits may still be
    running after the call returns, and placing it by its own start would credit it to
    whatever range happened to be open on the host at that moment -- a different node.

    A nested call's launches lie inside the outer call's interval too, so an outer range
    counts its children's device work. That is deliberate: it makes `device_us` mean the

"""hbm_bytes per timed cuDF call, from an Nsight Systems capture.

The calibration record deliberately has no hbm_bytes column: nothing inside the process
can count HBM traffic, so it comes from a profiled run and joins back on the record's own
coordinates. This is that join's producer.

WHY IT IS A SEPARATE RUN. The capture distorts what it measures -- +7% on a query and
+11% on a heavy scan, measured -- so the times and the traffic cannot come from one file.
They come from two runs joined on the tuple, which is the whole reason the record carries
a tuple rather than a node number.

    nsys profile --trace=nvtx,cuda --sample=none --cpuctxsw=none \
                 --gpu-metrics-device=0 --gpu-metrics-set=<arch> \
                 --gpu-metrics-frequency=20000 -o cap -- <binary>
    nsys export --type=sqlite --force-overwrite=true -o cap.sqlite cap.nsys-rep
    scripts/calibration/nsys_hbm.py --capture cap.sqlite --record run.tsv --out hbm.tsv

The capture and the record given here must be from ONE run: they are joined on the
tuple, and a call in one that is not in the other means they describe different work. Any
number of CASES may be in that run — the harness wraps each in a named NVTX range, so the
capture says which query a call was in rather than being told on a command line.

Nsight's general metric set reports DRAM traffic as a percentage of the device's peak
bandwidth, not as bytes, so bytes are the integral of that percentage over the sampling
period times a peak the caller supplies. That makes --peak-bw part of the measurement
rather than a display detail, and a wrong one is a silent scale error on every row.
Checked once against a region whose traffic is known exactly -- a cast of N rows from an
8-byte to a 16-byte type has to read 8N and write 16N -- which came out inside 2.4% on
both directions at the default peak.

Metric ids are looked up by name because they are a property of the capture, not of the
tool: a run whose ids were assumed rather than read produced a read column holding what
was really the write, and the error was only visible because a cast's traffic is known
in advance. Nothing downstream of here could have caught it.

The remaining checks are invariants a healthy capture cannot violate -- no sample above
100% of peak, no gap in the sampling cadence -- and they are asserted rather than trusted
because both failures degrade quietly: an interrupted collection leaves later regions
with an hbm_bytes of zero, which is what a region that moved no data also looks like.

"""Run-time state shared by the two drivers.

Output queues live on the *producing* node, not on the consumer's input edge. That is
what makes lane remapping free: an emitter reads its child's single out lane, a forwarder
reads whichever (child, lane) pair `sources_of` names, a join reads lane p of each side —
all without the producer knowing who consumes it.

"""Every join mode the engine can be asked for, on two backends that share no join code.

The engine keeps the FlatBuffers schema and the C++ operators frozen, and
that claim is worth exactly what the join can do — the join being the one operator whose
state has to survive a call. So each mode here runs twice: once on the pandas backend
(`operators/joins.py`), once on the backend that answers every call by emitting fb nodes
and making `execute_node` calls against the cuDF model (`operators/recipe_join.py`). A
disagreement between them is a real one, and the spec's join capability matrix is what they
are both asserting.

Split out of `test_end_to_end.py`, which it shares helpers with: same drivers, same
oracle-comparison rules, same budget. The join block simply outgrew that file.

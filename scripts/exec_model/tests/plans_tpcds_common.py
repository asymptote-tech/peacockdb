"""What every TPC-DS lowering in this suite is built out of.

TPC-DS is a star schema, and a star has one shape: a fact table streaming past dimension
tables small enough to sit in one batch. That shape is the shape the engine
exists for, so it is worth saying once — `fact`, `dim` and `star` below — and then spending
each query's lines on what is actually specific to it.

The family modules (`plans_tpcds_star.py` and its siblings) hold the queries; this holds
the vocabulary and `plans_tpcds.py` holds the registry.

"""`start..limit` — both lowerings, and the transfers the root-adjacent one avoids.

A limit is decided by position. Feeding only `GpuUnload` it is not a node at all: `skip`
and `fetch` are the unload's, and the driver counts rows across lanes, releases batches it
wants nothing from, narrows the calls that straddle the interval's ends, and stops
scheduling once `is_satisfied` holds. Anywhere else it stays a node over one merged
partition and streams: batches outside the interval are released uncalled, batches inside
are forwarded untouched, and only the two that straddle its ends are sliced.

**These tests assert on the `unload` calls, not on the rows that come back.** Both are the
same for a correct implementation, but only the first can tell the difference between a
limit and a filter applied after the fact — and that difference is the whole feature. A
batch unloaded and then discarded has already crossed PCIe.

Mock nodes throughout: what is under test is scheduling, not arithmetic.

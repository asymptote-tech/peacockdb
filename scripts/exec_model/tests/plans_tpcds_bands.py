"""TPC-DS: the banded queries — a disjunction that no scan can hold.

q13, q48 and q85 are one query written three times. Each pairs three *demographic* bands
with three *geographic* ones, and every arm of every disjunction reads one column from a
dimension and one from the fact row it qualifies — a marital status and a sale price, a
state and a net profit. So neither disjunction can be pushed to either table's scan, and
both have to be evaluated above the joins.

What *can* be pushed is the union of each disjunction's dimension arms: the three (marital
status, education) pairs, and the nine states. That is the pushdown a planner is entitled
to, it is what these lowerings do, and it is not the same thing as the predicate — the full
disjunction is still applied above the join, because dropping it would let a sale in Ohio
match Oregon's profit band.

The answer is one row: no group key, no ORDER BY, three averages and a sum.

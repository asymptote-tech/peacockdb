"""Reading the generated benchmark datasets, for the two corpus test files.

`test_tpch.py` and `test_tpcds.py` both run real query shapes over real tables, so they
share a reader, a budget and an oracle comparison. Nothing here is a test.

**Which dataset.** `testdata/tpch.sf1` and `testdata/tpcds.sf1`, which
`generate_testdata.sh` produces and CI's dataset-matrix job regenerates every run — which is why
both corpus files run there rather than in cost-report, where there is no dataset. TPC-H
falls back to the committed `testdata/tpch.minimal` for the five tables it holds; a query
naming a table neither dataset has **fails**, loudly, naming the generator. It does not
skip: a skipped corpus suite reads exactly like a passing one.

**Two casts on read**, both standing in for typing the prototype does not have:

- **decimals to float64.** TPC-H money is `decimal128(15, 2)` and pandas has no decimal
  dtype, so pyarrow hands back an object column of `Decimal`s that will not multiply by a
  float literal. `frame.py` names this divergence already; it is also why the real engine
  carries precision and scale in the flat buffers rather than letting cuDF re-derive them.
- **dates to `datetime64[ns]`.** A parquet `date32` arrives as an object column of
  `datetime.date`, which compares to nothing the expression IR can hold. cuDF's own type is
  `TIMESTAMP_DAYS`, a typed scalar, so datetime64 is the closer model.

**The corpus queries read whole tables.** They are the real queries with the spec's own
parameters, so they get the real data: sampling was tried and it is a trap. Both benchmarks
are written clustered by date (`generate_testdata.sh` ~L273, ~L322: lineitem `ORDER BY
l_shipdate, l_orderkey, l_linenumber`, every TPC-DS fact by its date_sk), which row-group
pruning depends on — so a row prefix is one quarter of 1992, a row-group sample is a set of
date windows, and two tables sampled independently join to nothing. Every one of those bit.
Whole tables have none of the problems and answer the question the corpus is asked to
answer.

`limit` therefore serves the short plan-shape tests only, where a few thousand rows of a
dimension table is the point.

The read cache is deliberately small: a full lineitem is a gigabyte of python objects, and
holding one per column-set across a file's worth of queries is how a runner runs out of
memory. Two reads of the same columns in one query share; a later query re-reads.

    `order_by` names the columns the query actually sorts on. Given them, only those are
    compared positionally and the rows themselves as a multiset — `matches_oracle`, the same
    split the TPC-DS side uses, and the whole of what SQL determines. q11 is why: it sorts
    on `value` alone, two of its parts hold the same value, and which of them comes first is
    open. Comparing every column positionally called that a wrong answer.

    Without `order_by` every column is compared positionally, which asserts more than SQL
    promises. The rest of the TPC-H corpus satisfies it because their sort keys are unique
    in this data. A query that starts failing there has found a tie, and the fix is to name
    its `order_by` here — not to re-sort the oracle until the two agree.

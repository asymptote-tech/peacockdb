"""Simple plans over real TPC-H tables, with the resident accountant switched on.

Not the TPC-H queries — hand-built plans of the shapes the mode exists for (filter into a
shuffled aggregate, a small build side against a streamed probe, a top-N across lanes),
run over real column types, real cardinalities and real skew rather than the synthetic
fixtures of `test_end_to_end.py`. Each is checked against a pandas oracle over the same
frames, so the assertions do not depend on which dataset was found.

**Which dataset.** `testdata/tpch.sf1` when it exists, otherwise the committed
`testdata/tpch.minimal`. This file runs in the **dataset-matrix** job, right after
`generate_testdata.sh` produces sf1 — the rest of the prototype suite runs in cost-report,
which has no dataset. The fallback is for local runs where sf1 was never generated: for
the four tables used here the two are the same data (same schema, same row counts —
customer 150000, supplier 10000, nation 25, region 5), so the assertions hold either way.
`part` is deliberately unused: its schema differs between the two.

**The accountant is on.** Every plan runs under a real budget, so the accounting path is
live and a regression that blew the resident set would trip rather than pass quietly.

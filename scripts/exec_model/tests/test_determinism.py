"""Two runs of the same plan produce the same batch trace and the same batches.

Scheduling has no freedom left: the choice key `(height, order)` is a total order over
the tree, lanes are visited by index, and a forwarder cycles `sources_of` from a cursor.
That matters beyond golden stability — float aggregation sums in stream order, so an
unpinned order changes low bits.

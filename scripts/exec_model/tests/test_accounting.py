"""Resident accounting, against the formula the spec states.

    resident = Σ byte_size of driver-held in-flight batches
             + Σ cached resident_bytes() over live executors

Two properties get most of the attention. The cached executor total must equal what a live
sum would give — caching is the whole point (it is what lets the Rust port drop the
accountant's references to every executor) and a cache that drifts is worse than no cache.
Model-versus-measured is deliberately NOT among them. `scratch_bytes` is an estimate — a
join's rests on the optimizer's cardinality figure, a filter's on assumed selectivity — so
it will sometimes come in under, and the accountant is built for that ("fail cleanly when the
accounted peak exceeds the budget"). What is tested is that under-estimates are *recorded*
with their magnitude, not that they never happen.

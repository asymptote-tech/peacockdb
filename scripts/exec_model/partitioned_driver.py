"""`partitioned_driver` — the scheduler and everything cross-partition.

**The strategy.** Every node carries a height (distance to the root) and a left-to-right
order, both computed once in `plan.py`. A node is *runnable* when any of its partitions
can make progress: a source always can, and any other node can once its inputs for that
lane hold a batch or are known to be finished. Among all runnable nodes the driver picks
the one with the smallest height, breaking ties leftmost, and then runs **every** lane of
that node.

Min-height-first is what makes this a push model: as soon as a node produces a batch its
parent becomes runnable at a strictly lower height, so the batch is carried up the tree
before anything below produces again. It stops at a batch accumulator, a partition
accumulator, or the sink — which is also the livelock argument. The one place a batch can
be blocked is a join whose other side has not arrived; orienting the tree so the build
side is always the left child removes that wait, because at equal heights the leftmost
node wins and the build subtree drains first.

**Queues stay bounded at one batch per lane, with no explicit cap.** A producer's
out-queue is drained by its parent before the producer runs again, since the parent's
height is strictly lower. The one shape that breaks it is a join in its build phase — it
cannot consume a probe batch yet, so nothing drains its probe child — and that is closed
by holding the join's whole probe subtree until the build is set (`_held_by_a_join_build`).
With the hold in place the bound is unconditional, and the draft's cap-Q mechanism is
unnecessary — nothing here caps a queue.

Lane-scoped work is delegated to `single_partition_driver`; this driver owns the
tree, the queues, the schedule, and the three cross-lane categories.

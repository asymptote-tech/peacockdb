"""`validate_schemas_and_partitions()` — what each node needs of its children.

Split from the whole-tree rules in `plan.py` on purpose, and the spec says why: a node
knows what it requires and can name the fix, where a generic rule can only say what is
wrong. "A limit over four lanes" should read *the planner inserts `GpuMergePartitions`
below it*, not *this category is 1:1 per lane*. `Plan.validate` runs these first for that
reason.

Two families live here.

**Layout expectations** — the parts of a child's `PartitionLayout` a node depends on:
hash distribution, sortedness, batch layout. These are exactly the properties that make a
plan silently wrong rather than loudly broken. A join whose sides are not co-partitioned
still runs and still returns rows; it returns too few, because lane p of one side was
joined against lane p of the other and the matching rows were in different lanes.

**Aggregate annotations** — the state-schema chain. A merging or finalizing aggregate
checks that the state it is about to read is the state its own partial declared: same
aggregate, same function, same positions. Without it a merge trusts a position, which is
[#135](../../../llm-wiki/archive/archived-tickets.md#t135)'s class of defect — right column count, wrong
column, identical per-node statistics, wrong answer at the root.

A child that declares no schema is not an error: sources, projects and joins build columns
this prototype does not model, and a check that cannot be made is skipped rather than
guessed at.

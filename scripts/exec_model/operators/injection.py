"""`LayoutInjector` — re-shape a plan's partitioning and batching, keep its answer.

A query's result is a function of its rows, not of how those rows were divided. Everything
the model adds — lanes, batches, shuffles, accumulators — is machinery
underneath that invariant, and the way to test machinery like that is to vary it as
violently as the engine permits and demand the same answer every time.

That is what this does. Give it a plan built from `nodes.py` and it hands back an
equivalent plan whose lanes, row groups, batch sizes and hash placement are whatever the
chosen preset says. The plans in `test_tpch.py` are written once, at whatever partitioning
reads clearly, and then run at every shape.

**Why rebuilding rather than editing.** A node's partitioning is not a field: the source
captured a row-group mapping computed at build time, the emitter captured its lane count,
every parent computed its own layout from its child's. Editing one would leave the rest
inconsistent — so a rewrite re-runs the builder with different arguments, which is what
`nodes.Recipe` records for.

**What may not be re-partitioned.** A join is correct at N lanes only if both sides are
hash-partitioned on the join keys into the same N. Where a plan joins two streams that were
never shuffled — a small build side against a scan, the shape v1 leans on — its one lane is
load-bearing, and the injector leaves that subtree's lane count alone while still varying
its batching. Getting this wrong would not fail the plan validator; it would silently
compute a join of matching slices and return too few rows.

**Why a degenerate hash is a legal hash.** The submodes include placements that send three
quarters of the keys to one lane, or all of them. A shuffle's contract is co-location —
equal keys reach the same lane — and nothing above it may depend on how evenly the lanes
were loaded. Every placement here is a pure function of the key columns, so every one of
them satisfies the contract, and a plan that only works under a well-spread hash is broken
rather than unlucky.

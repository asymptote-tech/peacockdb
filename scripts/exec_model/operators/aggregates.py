"""Aggregate specs and the three-part decomposition.

An aggregate is declared as three things, and every node runs the parts it needs — there
is no phase flag anywhere (`llm-wiki/architecture.md`, "The aggregate sequence"):

- **init** (`partial`) — aggregators over raw rows, emitting *state* columns. One aggregate
  may emit several: `avg` emits sum and count, `stddev` emits Welford's count, mean and m2.
- **merge** (`merge`) — aggregators over state columns, emitting the same state schema.
  Not the same functions as init: a `count` merges by `sum`, and Welford state merges by
  `merge_m2`.
- **finalize** (`finalize_exprs`) — one expression per output column, over the merged
  state. `avg` is a divide, `stddev` a CASE over a sqrt, `count` and `sum` a rename.

`finalize_exprs` is the prototype's version of the decomposition registry the translation
layer will own: the one place that knows how a SQL aggregate becomes plan-level nodes and
expressions, so adding an aggregate is a row here rather than an arm in C++.

Three rules from the wiki are load-bearing and all three are easy to get wrong:

- **A mean-type aggregate must decompose to partial SUM + COUNT and never average partial
  means** (build-test.md's multi-GPU note), which is why `state_columns` distinguishes an
  aggregate's state schema from its output schema at all.
- **Grouped aggregation includes the null group.** cuDF is called with
  `null_policy::INCLUDE` and dropping it loses tpcds q15's NULL `ca_zip` row
  (architecture.md, cuDF options). pandas `groupby` drops NaN keys by default, so every
  groupby here passes `dropna=False`.
- **A stddev/var merge is Welford, not an average of deviations.** Combining two partials
  needs the count-weighted mean and the cross term `n_a·n_b/(n_a+n_b)·(mean_b−mean_a)²`,
  which is what cuDF's MERGE_M2 does and what `_merge_frame` reproduces here.

`COUNT(*)` and `COUNT(col)` are different aggregates, not one with a flag: the first counts
rows, the second counts non-nulls, and picking the wrong one is always wrong for the other
(architecture.md's rolling-count row).

"""The hash scatter — `GpuEmitPartitions`, one call per input batch, N outputs.

The real kernel is a bit-exact Spark murmur3 at seed 42, chosen so the CPU and GPU place
every row in the same partition by construction (architecture.md, "Rehash and the comet
hash"). crc32 stands in for it here: what the prototype needs is *a* deterministic hash
with the same structural rules, not comet's bits.

The structural rule that does matter is null handling. The kernel skips null columns, so a
row whose key columns are all null hashes to the seed alone and every such row lands in the
one partition `pmod(seed, N)`. That is comet-mandated and not a knob — it is why #137 wants
the planner to filter null keys out ahead of the shuffle on sides whose unmatched rows are
never emitted, rather than teach the kernel to scatter them.

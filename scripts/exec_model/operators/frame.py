"""The pandas-backed batch, and the rules that keep pandas inside cuDF's vocabulary.

pandas is the backend because it is available everywhere; cuDF is what the real executors
will call. Those two disagree in ways that would let a prototype operator "work" and its
C++ twin fail, so every operator here is written against the intersection, and the
divergences are named rather than avoided by accident.

**The subset rules.** Each one exists because breaking it produces a prototype that cannot
be ported:

1. **No index.** A `cudf::table` is an ordered collection of columns and nothing else.
   pandas carries an Index that silently aligns operands in arithmetic and reappears after
   a filter. Every frame that enters or leaves an operator here is passed through
   `normalize`, which resets it. Without that, `a[mask] + b[mask]` aligns on original row
   labels and quietly produces a correct-looking answer no cuDF kernel would give.
2. **No `apply`, no python callables.** cuDF evaluates an AST of typed operations. Anything
   expressible only as a row-wise python lambda has no counterpart, so `expressions.py`
   offers a fixed operator set and nothing else.
3. **Explicit null placement on every sort.** `cudf::order` and `cudf::null_order` are
   separate arguments; pandas defaults `na_position="last"`. Sorts here always pass both.
4. **Explicit null equality on every join.** pandas `merge` matches NaN keys to each other.
   SQL does not, and `GpuHashJoin.null_equals_null` carries the choice per join
   (architecture.md). Joins here take the flag and implement both meanings.
5. **Concatenate requires identical column names in identical order**, as
   `cudf::concatenate` requires identical types — so mismatches raise here rather than
   being reconciled by pandas' union-of-columns behaviour.

**Known divergences that remain**, because pandas cannot express them: no decimal128 (the
real engine's scale handling is the #55/#56 bug class and is out of scope here), and
integer columns holding nulls become float64 in pandas, which cuDF would keep as a
nullable integer.

`partition_row_groups` is a prototype of the spec's `ParquetBatchPartitioner` (task T2):
one pure function, computed once at plan time, whose output everything else consumes
verbatim. Row groups stand in for parquet's, since there is no parquet here — the shape of
the mapping is what matters, not where the rows came from.

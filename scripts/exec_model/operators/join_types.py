"""Join types and the capability matrix, as data both backends read.

`JoinType` is `gpu_plan.fbs`'s enum, values included: one vocabulary for the pandas
executors, the recipe emulation and the spec's table, so a claim in one is the claim in
the others. A cross join is not a member — the wire has a node kind for it
(`CudfCrossJoin`) and no join type — and neither is a "nested loop" type: that is also a
node kind, carrying `Inner` or `Left` from this same enum.

**The capability question** the engine asks of each type is one thing: with
the build side complete and the probe side arriving in batches, can this type answer from
one probe batch at a time? Three answers, and each is a property of where the type's
unmatched rows come from:

- **probe-local** — every output row is decided by (the whole build, this probe batch), so
  streaming needs nothing extra. Inner, Right, RightSemi, RightAnti.
- **build-preserving** — the output includes build rows that matched *nothing across every
  probe batch*, which no single batch can know. Streaming needs a finish pass, and the
  finish pass needs the probe keys kept ([#136](../../../llm-wiki/tickets.md#t136)).
  Left, Full, LeftSemi, LeftAnti, LeftMark.
- **refused** — a shape with no path on the frozen C++ surface at all.

A residual filter cuts across that: the finish pass sees accumulated *keys*, and a keys-only
table cannot evaluate a predicate over both sides' columns. So a filtered build-preserving
join does not stream, and the planner gives it a single-batch probe — which is the legacy
call, one `CudfHashJoin` over the whole probe side.

    unbounded saving on an offset. A batch entirely inside is **forwarded untouched**, so
    the ordinary case costs nothing at all. Only the two that straddle the interval's ends
    are **sliced**, through `peacock_executor_slice_handle`, whose bounds are call
    arguments rather than plan constants; the copy is bounded by the rows kept, which are
    the rows about to be used anyway.

    That symbol is what makes this streaming rather than accumulating. Without it the
    bounds would have to come from the frozen fb node, which is only correct against a
    table starting at row 0 of the stream — so the node would have to hold the whole
    prefix, and `OFFSET 1000000 LIMIT 10` would hold a million rows to return ten. With it,
    residency is zero and the driver still stops the scan the moment the interval is
    covered.

    Input is one partition (`GpuMergePartitions` beneath, checked on the node) and any
    number of batches. Requiring one batch is what would put a `GpuCoalesceAllBatches`

    **Compaction runs on a byte threshold that doubles when it fails to pay.** The two
    obvious policies are each wrong in one regime. Compacting on every arrival keeps the
    held state at group cardinality, but it re-scans that state once per batch: when the
    groups are disjoint and nothing merges, the state grows every time and the total work
    is quadratic in the batch count. Never compacting holds every partial to the end,
    which is the whole input when the group cardinality is high.

    So: hold arrivals until they cross `threshold` bytes, compact once, then raise the
    threshold to twice what the compaction left behind. A low-cardinality aggregate leaves
    a small state, so the threshold never moves and residency stays near group
    cardinality on a fraction of the calls per-arrival would make. A high-cardinality one
    leaves a state as big as its input, so the threshold doubles away and the compactions
    land at geometrically growing sizes — total re-scan work linear in the rows that pass
    through, instead of quadratic — and it stops paying for a merge that merges nothing.

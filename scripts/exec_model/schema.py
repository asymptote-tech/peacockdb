"""What a node declares about its output *columns*, in lieu of a full schema.

The real implementation carries column types here too (task T7) and renders them in the
plan golden. The prototype deliberately does not: types are the part a pandas stand-in
would model badly, and they are not what the aggregate sequence's validation needs. What
it needs is the semantics — which columns are group keys, and which columns are one
aggregate's state — so that a merging or finalizing node can check it is reading the state
its own partial produced rather than trusting a position.

That check is the prototype's answer to the class [#135](../../llm-wiki/archive/archived-tickets.md#t135)
describes: every column reference is an index into the child's output and almost nothing
verifies it, so a node reading the right *number* of columns in the wrong order produces
identical per-node statistics everywhere and surfaces only at the root. Here the index and
the name are declared together and cross-checked, which is the same pairing the spec's
node-display rule settles on for goldens.

Nodes that merely re-lane or re-batch their input forward their child's declaration
unchanged; nodes that build new columns (project, join) declare nothing, and a consumer of
an undeclared schema simply skips the check rather than inventing one.

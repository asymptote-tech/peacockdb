"""Resident accounting and enforcement, in the shape the spec's Memory accounting states.

    resident = Σ byte_size of driver-held in-flight batches
             + Σ cached resident_bytes() over live executors

Per call: pre-check `resident + scratch_bytes(n_rows, n_bytes)` against the budget;
execute; remove consumed inputs, add outputs at actual `byte_size()`, refresh the one
executor's `resident_bytes()` delta, post-check.

Two details of that are load-bearing rather than incidental. The executor total is
**cached and refreshed one instance at a time**, not summed over every live executor per
check — the sum is what a Python prototype reaches for and it is also what forces the
accountant to hold a reference to every executor, which the Rust port cannot do while the
driver holds them mutably. Caching by key removes the aliasing along with the cost. And
`CallStats.scratch_bytes` is the *measured* transient — the CPU measures directly, the GPU
through RMM allocator hooks — so the modelled figure can be compared against it. `None`
means the run was not instrumented.

**That comparison is a diagnostic, not an invariant.** `scratch_bytes` is an estimate and
estimates are wrong: a join's model rests on the optimizer's cardinality figure, a filter's
on assumed selectivity, and neither is guaranteed. Under-estimates are recorded with their
magnitude, so model quality is visible and a regression is noticeable — they are not
asserted away. The accountant is built for exactly this: its contract is "fail cleanly when
the accounted peak exceeds the budget", not "the accounting is never wrong".

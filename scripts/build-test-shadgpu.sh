# Build for the GPU host, ship, patch, and either gate on it or measure it.
#
# The gate (--run) and the benchmark run (--run-benchmarks) are one script because they
# share a toolchain, target dir, push and patch. They must never share an exit code: one
# number cannot mean both "correctness passed" and "measurement completed", and OR-ing
# them makes a benchmark-infrastructure failure read as a test regression. Hence the
# validation block, and two staging dirs:
#
#   cpp/install/rust-tests/        swept by --run's glob      -> gate
#   cpp/install/rust-benchmarks/   not swept                  -> measurement
#
# --run enforces that rather than documenting it: a benchmark binary under rust-tests/
# turns the run red.
#
# --build / --build-benchmarks need a cuDF toolchain, in practice scripts/docker-build.sh.
# Every later phase needs this workstation's ssh keys and is refused in the container,
# where the failure would surface as an ssh error deep inside a phase.
#
# USAGE
#   ./scripts/build-test-shadgpu.sh --all                # gate: build+push+patch+run

#   ./scripts/build-test-shadgpu.sh --push-binaries --patch --run-benchmarks --pull-benchmarks
#
# Both runs take tens of minutes, hence a detached form for each:
#   ./scripts/build-test-shadgpu.sh --push-binaries --patch --run-benchmarks-detached

#
# BENCHMARK OUTPUT
#   testdata/benchmark-results/<dataset>.sf<sf>/<mode>.benchmark.txt
# one file per (dataset, mode), holding a section per query timed at that mode. A run
# with no filter times every declared mode, and each mode's sections land in its own
# file — the modes do not share one. Written on the GPU host and copied back by
# --pull-benchmarks; llm-wiki/build-test.md has the file format.
#
#   testdata/calibration/records.tsv        (git-ignored)
# The same run also emits calibration rows, one per cuDF CALL. Unconditionally
# rather than behind a flag: the rows are derived from the run that wrote the tree
# above, and a flag someone has to remember is a way for the two to silently
# disagree about which measurement they describe. Truncated at the start of every
# run -- one file per run is what a reader gets, and appending across runs would mix
# build profiles and allocators under one header. One file for every mode: `mode`
# is a column, and what must not mix is the CONDITIONS, which the `# run:` heading
# holds and record.rs refuses to merge across.
#
#   testdata/calibration/records-hbm.tsv    (PCK_BENCH_HBM only)
#   testdata/calibration/capture-hbm.sqlite
# The HBM pass's pair, and deliberately not the files above. Its times are measured
# under GPU memory counters that cost the query ~7%, so it is read for TRAFFIC and
# never for microseconds; nsys_hbm.py joins the two into hbm.tsv, whose tuple then
# joins onto the clean records.tsv. That pass also writes no .benchmark.txt at all.

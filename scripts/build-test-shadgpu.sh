#
# Build for the GPU host, ship, patch, and gate on it.
#
# The gate (--run) and the benchmark run (--run-benchmarks) are one script because they
# share a toolchain, target dir, push and patch. They must never share an exit code: one
# number cannot mean both "correctness passed" and "measurement completed", and OR-ing
# them makes a benchmark-infrastructure failure read as a test regression. Hence the
# validation block, and two staging dirs:
#
#   cpp/install/rust-tests/        swept by --run's glob      -> gate
#   cpp/install/rust-benchmarks/   not swept                  -> measurement
#
# --run enforces that rather than documenting it: a benchmark binary under rust-tests/
# turns the run red.
#
# --build / --build-benchmarks need a cuDF toolchain, in practice scripts/docker-build.sh.
# Every later phase needs this workstation's ssh keys and is refused in the container,
# where the failure would surface as an ssh error deep inside a phase.
#
# USAGE
#   ./scripts/build-test-shadgpu.sh --all                # build+push+patch+run
#
# Both runs take tens of minutes, hence a detached form for each:
#   ./scripts/build-test-shadgpu.sh --push-binaries --patch --run-benchmarks-detached
#   ./scripts/build-test-shadgpu.sh --benchmark-status    # going? finished? log tail
#   ./scripts/build-test-shadgpu.sh --pull-benchmarks     # once it reports finished
#
#   PCK_TEST_FILTER=bench_tpch_sf1_q1 ./scripts/build-test-shadgpu.sh --run-benchmarks
#
# BENCHMARK OUTPUT
#   testdata/benchmark-results/<dataset>.sf<sf>/<mode>.benchmark.txt
# one file per (dataset, mode), holding a section per query timed at that mode. A run
# with no filter times every declared mode, and each mode's sections land in its own
# file — the modes do not share one. Written on the GPU host and copied back by
# --pull-benchmarks; llm-wiki/build-test.md has the file format.
#
#   testdata/calibration/records.tsv        (git-ignored)
# The same run also emits calibration rows, one per cuDF CALL. Unconditionally
# rather than behind a flag: the rows are derived from the run that wrote the tree
# above, and a flag someone has to remember is a way for the two to silently
# disagree about which measurement they describe. Truncated at the start of every
# run -- one file per run is what a reader gets, and appending across runs would mix
# build profiles and allocators under one header. One file for every mode: `mode`
# is a column, and what must not mix is the CONDITIONS, which the `# run:` heading
# holds and record.rs refuses to merge across.

Knobs read from the environment, not flags:

--all deliberately does NOT imply the benchmark phases: that is what keeps a
measurement out of the merge gate.

Nsight captures are scripts/create_nsys_profile.sh, which runs against the binaries
this script pushes.

A status flag exits 0 only when the latest run of that phase finished with 0.

# /dev/null, since the process would otherwise block or die on the closed channel.

# given and ORs the exit codes, because a single crashing binary must not hide every
# later one's result. That is a property of the runner, not of the launcher.
#

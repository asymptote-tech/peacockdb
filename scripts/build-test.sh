# build-test-shadgpu.sh (build here, ship binaries, run there). Three suites,
# selected by the mode flags below (cpu is the default):
#
#   cpu (default)  C++ peacock_cpu_tests + every Rust target that builds with cmake
#                (a SUPERSET of --rust-only, plus test_ffi). No flag selects it —
#                see usage(): a flag whose only effect is the default is noise.
#   --rust-only   every Rust target that builds WITHOUT cmake — see build-test.md's
#                "What rust-only means". Golden regen + cpu/plan verify.
#   --gpu        C++ peacock_plan_tests + the GPU-runtime Rust targets, run
#                one-at-a-time on the GPU.
# The three sets are DERIVED from the sources, not listed here — see the suite
# selection below. A mode that builds more must not run less.
#
# The remote host is NOT hardcoded — pass it with --host. We build locally
# against a cuDF that matches the remote's ABI (default: a local cudf-26.02
# env), ship cpp/install (the lib + C++ test binaries + staged Rust binaries),
# and run them against the remote's cuDF runtime. There is no --patch step
# (the remote is a modern-glibc host, unlike the shad-gpu path).
#
# NOTE: every Rust test binary honors PEACOCK_TESTDATA_DIR now, unit tests included,
# and falls back to the compile-time path (CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR, symlinks canonicalized)
# only where it is unset. --gpu and --rust-only set it below; the plain cpu mode does
# not, so that one still looks for testdata at this box's absolute repo path and the
# remote must expose the same — e.g. a symlink /media/data/peacockdb -> <remote repo>.

Usage: build-test.sh --host <ssh-dest> [mode] <action...> [options]

  mode      (default cpu)
    --rust-only    every Rust target that builds WITHOUT cmake. Golden regen + verify.
    --gpu          the GPU-runtime targets; needs a GPU on the remote.
    (no --cpu flag: cpu IS the default, and a flag whose only effect is the default
     is noise. --gpu and --rust-only are mutually exclusive and rejected, not ordered.)

  MODE LADDER: rust-only ⊂ cpu ⊂ gpu-capable. A mode that BUILDS more never RUNS less —
  the three suites are derived from the sources, not listed, so they cannot drift apart.

  actions (at least one required)
    --build              build C++ (unless --rust-only) + stage the Rust test binaries
    --push-binaries      ship cpp/install + the goldens the binaries assert against
    --run                run the suite on the remote
    --all                --build --push-binaries --run
    --push-<kind>        parquet | queries | goldens | duckdb-profiles | duckdb-dynfilters
    --pull-<kind>        parquet | goldens | duckdb-profiles | duckdb-dynfilters
                         (no --pull-queries: a --pull-<kind> exists only where the
                          remote can PRODUCE that kind. Queries are AUTHORED — nothing
                          on a remote generates a .sql — so pulling would overwrite
                          committed source with whatever a scratch host holds. The
                          other four are generated artifacts: parquet on verda,
                          goldens by --update-canonical, both duckdb sets by their
                          extractors.)
    --update-canonical   regen goldens during --run instead of asserting
    (--push-binaries always ships goldens: binaries without the fixtures they assert
     against is what produced 110/110 "canonical file not found". --push-goldens is the
     subset operation — refresh fixtures without rebuilding or reshipping binaries.)

  options
    --remote-dir <path> --local-cudf-root <path> --remote-cudf-root <path>
    --gcc-version <n>

  DELIBERATELY ABSENT, so these do not get filed as gaps:
    no --pull-binaries      binaries flow one way: built locally, shipped to the remote.
    no embeddings-cache     a per-host INTERMEDIATE for the tpch vector datasets
                            (fetch_embeddings.sh, ~1.8 GB, gitignored). Regenerate it
                            where you need it; syncing it would ship a derived artifact.
USAGE

}

# The ONE goldens push. It existed twice — the --push-binaries block used
# `rsync -r --delete`, --push-goldens used `rsync -a --delete` — same intent, different
# metadata handling, no shared code.
#
# PUSH MIRRORS (--delete); PULL IS ADDITIVE. The asymmetry is deliberate and must not be
# "fixed": the remote is a PARTIAL mirror. testdata/goldens/ contains tpch.sf40/ (16
# CSVs) and sf40 lives on shad-gpu, so mirroring downward from verda would DELETE
# fixtures that host never had — out of a git working tree.
#
# Accepted consequence: a regen that deletes a .result.txt (result over 256 KB, see
# maybe_write_result_golden) cannot propagate that deletion back through an additive
# pull. The deletion is announced on stderr and reaches the operator through the ssh
# heredoc; that is the handling, not a --delete armed for one rare case.
# #113: ship every COMMITTED testdata fixture, swept from git rather than named by hand.
#
# The hand list is the defect, not the missing file. build-test.sh shipped goldens and
# nothing else, so widening the rust-only suite surfaced two absent fixtures at once
# (cost-registry.csv, cost_model.conf) — and load_csv's own panic text had already
# predicted exactly this, naming the two OTHER provisioning paths that had been fixed
# one at a time. Three paths, three lists, each patched only when something broke.
#
# `--cached --others --exclude-standard` is #113's prescription and both halves matter:
#   --others         picks up a NEW fixture that is not committed yet; plain ls-files
#                    would miss it and reintroduce the same class.
#   --exclude-standard honours .gitignore, which is what keeps the ~1.7 GB of GENERATED
#                    parquet (tpch.sf1, tpcds.sf1) out — those are produced on the
#                    remote, not shipped to it.
# Do NOT add --exclude=*.parquet: tpch.minimal commits 5 parquet files the tests need.
#
# goldens are excluded here and pushed by sync_goldens instead — they are the one kind
# that must MIRROR (--delete) so a regen's baseline is the committed set exactly.

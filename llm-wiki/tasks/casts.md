# Export types: predicted at plan time, carried on the wire

Kind: production

Two device cells fail on the same class of thing — the device hands back a column whose Arrow type
is not the one the plan declared — and each is currently discovered at the boundary rather than
predicted before it. This task writes the prediction down where it can be checked, and closes both.

**This task closes [#183](active-tickets.md#t183)** — the device exports `Utf8` where the sink declares
`Utf8View` — by predicting the export type at plan time and casting the one divergence that is
inherent.

Its sibling [`wire-schema.md`](wire-schema.md) closes [#187](active-tickets.md#t187) with the same
derivation and the C++ half this task deliberately leaves out. Do this one first: it is Rust-only,
and the prediction it writes down is what the other one then makes true for decimals.


## Why they happen

`unload` concatenates the decoded IPC batches against the sink's declared schema
(`gpu_backend.rs:166`), and `concat_batches` requires exact type equality. Neither side is
misbehaving:

- cuDF has exactly one string type. `expr.cpp:74` maps the `Utf8View` tag to `type_id::STRING` and
  `cudf::to_arrow_schema` maps that back to `arrow::utf8()`. The divergence is inherent and the
  cast is the only place to absorb it.
- cuDF's decimal type carries **scale but not precision**. `export_table_to_ipc` builds its metadata
  as `col_meta.push_back({name})` — name only — so `decimals_to_arrow` falls back to
  `metadata.precision.value_or(max_precision<__int128_t>())`, which is 38. Every decimal exports at
  precision 38 with scale preserved. That is why `tpch/filter-project` declares `(15,2)` and receives
  `(38,2)`, and why `q6` never hit it: its sums declare `Decimal128(38,4)` already.

The second is a missing argument, not a disagreement between two engine rules. #187's current text
frames it as the CPU's `widened_decimal` and the device's concat disagreeing about the same bytes;
that framing is wrong and the ticket should be corrected when it is closed.

## The work

### 1. `export_type_for` — the composition, written down once

The round trip Arrow → fb → cuDF → Arrow lives in three files and two languages today, so nobody can
answer "what type will the device hand back for this column?" without reading `expr.cpp`. Make it a
Rust function. It is total over the declared type for every case below.

| declared | fb tag | cuDF | exported | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Boolean`, `Int8`–`Int64`, `UInt8`–`UInt64`, `Float32/64` | direct | direct | same | identity |
| `Utf8` | `Utf8` | `STRING` | `Utf8` | identity |
| `Date32` | `Date32` | `TIMESTAMP_DAYS` | `Date32` | identity, via `to_arrow_schema`'s `default:` arm |
| `Utf8View` | `Utf8View` | `STRING` | `Utf8` | **#183** |
| `LargeUtf8` | `LargeUtf8` | `STRING` | `Utf8` | same shape, no corpus query reaches it |
| `Date64` | `Date64` | `TIMESTAMP_MILLISECONDS` | `Timestamp(ms, None)` | no corpus query declares it |
| `Decimal128(p,s)` | `Decimal128` | `DECIMAL128` | `Decimal128(38,s)` | **#187** — predicted here, **not cast here**; [`wire-schema.md`](wire-schema.md) removes the divergence instead |
| `Null`, `Float16`, `Binary`, `LargeBinary`, `BinaryView` | mapped | **`EMPTY`** | — | **refuse** |

The last row is not a cast. `convert_data_type` serializes all five and `fb_to_type_id` has no case
for any of them, so they reach the device as a typeless column. `export_type_for` returns `Err` and
the plan is refused at planning time, which is what happens to them today only by accident.

### 2. Derive `exports` inside `attach_recipes`

Not a separate pass and not in the recipe writers, which are the wire codec rather than a
planning phase. The recipe walk already delivers the input:

```rust
fn unload(
    _node: &GpuUnload,
    _inputs: &[&Schema],     // the sink's declared schema, already here, unused
    _writer: &mut Writer,
) -> Result<Option<Recipe>, PlanError>
```

`_inputs` is exactly what `export_type_for` needs, handed to the one function already positioned at
the sink. Deriving it there costs no second traversal and creates no second place that has to agree
with the first — the hazard `driver/index.rs:151` exists to guard for node numbering.

The result is a per-column identity-or-cast list, carried to `GpuSink::new`
(`gpu_backend.rs:124`) alongside the schema the driver already passes it.

**The cast at `unload` must be narrow.** `concat_batches` against the declared schema is today the
only check that the device produces what the plan says it produces; it is what surfaced #187. A
blanket cast-to-schema fixes #183 and destroys that. Only the arms the table marks as divergent are
cast; every other mismatch still fails, as `export_table_to_ipc`'s `DECIMAL32/64 → DECIMAL128`
widening is a named normalization rather than a general one.

Two review points, both of which lose a check if missed:

- `self.schema.fields().zip(batch.columns())` truncates silently on a column-count mismatch, which
  `concat_batches` catches today. Check the length explicitly.
- Non-string divergences would fail at `RecordBatch::try_new` rather than at `concat_batches`, so
  `"the exported stream is not the sink's rows: {error}"` moves with them or #187-class failures lose
  the message the tickets quote.

### 3. Unit tests

`recipe/tests.rs` already asserts on the buffer where the recipe cannot answer, with the idiom at
`a_finalize_project_emits_the_group_keys_the_finalize_list_leaves_out`: build the node, run its
recipe fn, `writer.finish()`, `flatbuffers::root::<fb::GpuPlan>`, `node_at(seq)`, assert on payload
fields. No GPU, no session, no plan load.

- **exports at the unload** — pure function of the input schema, so it needs neither the buffer nor
  `finish()`. A `GpuUnload` over `Utf8View` + `Decimal128(15,2)` + `Int64` derives a list naming the
  divergent columns and omitting the identity ones.
- **the `EMPTY` class refuses** — `Binary`, `Null`, `Float16` return `Err` rather than passing
  silently. This is the arm most likely to rot, since no corpus query reaches it.
- **a decimal predicts but does not cast** — `export_type_for` reports `Decimal128(15,2) →
  Decimal128(38,s)` and the unload's cast list omits it, so the prediction is recorded before its
  fix exists. `columns_of` hardcodes `DataType::Int64`, so this needs a sibling taking
  `(name, precision, scale)` — which [`wire-schema.md`](wire-schema.md) reuses.

`recipe/tests.rs` is at 887 lines against the 1000-line cap. These land around 930 — under, but the
next addition to that file forces the split rather than this one.

## Restriction

**Code and test changes are limited to what is written above.** No refactor of the surrounding
writer, no generalizing `export_type_for` beyond the table, no second cast site, no cleanup of
the recipe writers while passing through them. Anything else found on the way is a ticket.

## Goldens, and how each moves

| golden | how it moves | why |
|---|---|---|
| `*.plans.txt` (10 files) | every `GpuUnload` line gains `exports=` | new field; `GpuUnload` renders bare today |
| `<mode>-<tier>.cpu.txt` | **no change** | `memory.rs:43` prices `Utf8View` and `Utf8` identically at `(rows+1)*4`, and content size is Σ value lengths for both |
| `<mode>-<tier>.cost.txt` | **no change** | derived from the `.cpu.txt` sections, which do not move |
| `<tier>.result.txt` | **no change** | values are unaffected; only types were ever in question |
| `testdata/cost-registry.csv` | device cells move off #183/#187 | see the device workflow below |

`exports=` renders on every unload, including `exports=none` where nothing diverges. Omitting the
attribute would make "nothing diverges" and "the list was never computed" identical in the golden,
which is the invisible-absence shape `coding-style.md` records twice.

`exports=` is a Rust-side prediction that the C++ never receives: the unload writes no payload, so
nothing on the wire describes the sink's columns. The golden is documentation and a tripwire, and
the runtime check at `unload` is the only thing that enforces it. [`wire-schema.md`](wire-schema.md)
is what makes it checkable against the buffer.

## Device workflow

The cast and the precision are not proved by a green CPU tier — every cell they exist for is a device
cell that is currently disabled. After the code lands:

1. Run the affected corpus queries on `shad-gpu` with `build-test-shadgpu.sh`, in batches of about
   five, as T19 does. **59 queries carry #183** — every query with a string in its sink schema,
   which is derivable from `tp1-single.plans.txt` without running anything, and was: no query
   without a string in its sink carries #183, over 82 checked, with no exceptions.
2. For each, **either enable the device cells or update the ticket**. A cell that now reaches a
   different cause is a cell whose ticket changes, not a cell that stays where it was — and the
   causes are ordered, so fixing #183 will move cells onto whatever refuses next rather than turning
   them all green. Expect #152 to be the common landing place.
3. Close #183 only when its cells are gone from the registry, not when the code lands. A ticket
   whose cells are still disabled against it is not closed.

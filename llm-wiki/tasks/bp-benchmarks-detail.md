# bp-benchmarks — detail

## Where the task starts

`origin/ENS-bp-benchmarks` exists with PR #139 open against master: 26 commits over
`c42b601`, 98 files. It is a complete first version of the four products, written before
`drop-mode-name` (#141) and `module-layout` (#143) were merged, so it names
`src/batch_partitioned/**`, `bp_*` modes and `test_gpu_bp_corpus`, and a merge with master
conflicts in 25 files. The spec was written after the branch, from a whole-branch reading;
every decision in it removes something the branch carries. The plan is written from the
final state, layer by layer, and does not depend on how the branch reaches master's layout.

## What the branch has that the spec keeps

The timing model (CUDA events, no sync inside a region), the ABI-call journal and its
`call_index` join, `Measured`/`Region`/`Measurements`, `render_timings`, the harness with its
six assertions, `record.rs`, `test_node_timing`, the shell phases, the three Python scripts,
the data-flow diagram and the Corpus Benchmarks section. Port these from
`git show origin/ENS-bp-benchmarks:<path>` as the plan directs.

## What the spec removes or replaces

The host_setup/host_submit split and `mark_device_start` in `operators/*.cpp`, `expr.cpp`
and its two thread-locals; `logical_size_from_table`, `call_outcome`, `PEACOCK_LOG_LOGICAL_BYTES`
and the `rows`/`logical_bytes` region fields; `[profile.benchmarks]` and `build.rs`'s
profile probe; the 20 % ceiling in `test_node_timing`; `PEACOCK_NVTX` and
`PEACOCK_BENCHMARK_RESULTS_RO` (one `PEACOCK_BENCHMARK_CAPTURE`); `records-hbm.tsv` in git;
`calls.tsv` keyed without the case; the `date_part` cast and tickets #197/#198 (master holds
#191 and #65); ssh multiplexing, the rsync rc=23 exit and the `git ls-files` fixture sweep;
the `*.*.benchmark.txt` detector; `Exemption::NotRun` for the harness.

## Known defects of the branch a reviewer would raise

`create_nsys_profile.sh` calls a `die` nothing defines; `build-test.md` documents a tree
format the code never wrote; `architecture.md`'s ABI sentence still counts sixteen symbols
and names `measure_timing_floor_us`; the test table lists a deleted gtest; the harness is
compiled by no CI step.

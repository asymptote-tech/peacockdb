# bp-benchmarks — detail

## Where the task starts

`ENS-bp-benchmarks` is one commit on master: PR #139's 26 commits over `c42b601`, squashed
and re-homed into the component layout by the helper, with no build run on the result. The
old head is kept as `bp-benchmarks-v1` locally. What the re-homing did: `instrument.rs`,
`driver/measurements.rs` and `plan_text/bench_text.rs` sit under `executor/` and `plan_text/`
as private modules, with `Measured`, `Region`, `Measurements`, `AbiCall`, `AbiCalls`,
`RmmPool`, `NodeTiming`, `NvtxRange` and the free functions declared on the `executor`
facade; the harness uses master's mode names (`tp1_single`, `bench_…`); the tickets the spec
drops were left at master's copy. Expect the first build to fail on imports and on
`test_module_layout` — that is Task 3 and Task 5 of the plan, not a regression to bisect.
The spec was written from a whole-branch reading of the first version; every decision in
it removes something the branch carries. The plan is written from the final state.

## What the branch has that the spec keeps

The timing model (CUDA events, no sync inside a region), the ABI-call journal and its
`call_index` join, `Measured`/`Region`/`Measurements`, `render_timings`, the harness with its
six assertions, `record.rs`, `test_node_timing`, the shell phases, the three Python scripts,
the data-flow diagram and the Corpus Benchmarks section. Port these from
`git show origin/ENS-bp-benchmarks:<path>` as the plan directs.

## What the spec removes or replaces

The host_setup/host_submit split and `mark_device_start` in `operators/*.cpp`, `expr.cpp`
and its two thread-locals; `logical_size_from_table`, `call_outcome`, `PEACOCK_LOG_LOGICAL_BYTES`
and the `rows`/`logical_bytes` region fields; `[profile.benchmarks]` and `build.rs`'s
profile probe; the 20 % ceiling in `test_node_timing`; `PEACOCK_NVTX` and
`PEACOCK_BENCHMARK_RESULTS_RO` (one `PEACOCK_BENCHMARK_CAPTURE`); `records-hbm.tsv` in git;
`calls.tsv` keyed without the case; the `date_part` cast and tickets #197/#198 (master holds
#191 and #65); ssh multiplexing, the rsync rc=23 exit and the `git ls-files` fixture sweep;
the `*.*.benchmark.txt` detector; `Exemption::NotRun` for the harness.

## Known defects of the branch a reviewer would raise

`create_nsys_profile.sh` calls a `die` nothing defines; `build-test.md` documents a tree
format the code never wrote; `architecture.md`'s ABI sentence still counts sixteen symbols
and names `measure_timing_floor_us`; the test table lists a deleted gtest; the harness is
compiled by no CI step.

## Run log

Facts the coordinator established before the first dispatch:

- The reference for every "port from" in the plan is `bp-benchmarks-v1` (local branch,
  `bda00fc`), the same commit `origin/ENS-bp-benchmarks` holds until the first push. The
  first push replaces the remote with the squashed branch, so read the reference as
  `git show bp-benchmarks-v1:<path>`, never `origin/ENS-bp-benchmarks:<path>`.
- PR #139 is open, base `master`, head `ENS-bp-benchmarks`, and still shows the 26 old
  commits; the push at `reviewing` is a force-push that retargets its head to the squashed
  branch. The base stays `master`: this is the chain's first task.
- verda does not resolve; CPU tiers run locally. shad-gpu answers (H200, idle).
- The plan says "commit per task". The developer never commits; it stops at the boundary
  the dispatch names and the coordinator commits with the plan's message.
- Dispatch 1: plan Tasks 1 and 2 (the C++ instrument, the ABI and FFI declarations).

## Dispatch 1 — plan Tasks 1 and 2 (the C++ instrument, the ABI and the FFI)

### The seq a slice and an export are charged to, and what Task 4 owes it

The spec has four entry points open regions, but two of them take no seq: `wire/attach.rs`
builds `Call::bare(SliceHandle, …)` for `GpuLimit` and `Call::bare(ResultFromHandle, …)` for
`GpuUnload`, and neither node writes a wire node at all — `Call::target` is `None` and
`RecipePlan` has no seq for them. So C++ cannot be handed one, and the ABI signatures do not
change (the spec's symbol list does not grow them a parameter).

The rule implemented instead: **a region's seq is the node whose output the call handled.**
`execute_node` and `execute_scan_rowgroups` name it; the slice and the export take the seq of
the node that produced the handle, which `RegionSink::produced_by` records at every
`registry.emplace` while measuring. `slice_handle` propagates the producer onto its output, so
an export downstream of a limit still names the node that computed the rows. `call_index`
keeps counting per seq across all four entry points: a root node with one `execute_node` and
one export gets 0 and 1.

**What Task 4 must do for `join_regions` to close.** Every region has to be claimed by a
journalled `AbiCall` on `(seq, call_index)`, so `GpuExport::unload` and `LimitStream`'s slice
must journal a call, and they need the producing seq to do it. The cheap route: carry it on
`GpuBatch` — `GpuBatch::new` is called immediately after the call that produced it, where the
seq is in hand (`gpu_backend/mod.rs`, `calls.record(*seq, …)` is two lines away). Two things
are still undecided and are Task 4's to settle:

- `AbiCall::kind` is an `FbKind`, and neither bare symbol has one. Either widen the field or
  give the journal a kind for the two.
- C++ counts `call_index` in real call order. The driver stamps it per seq in `record_calls`,
  over the journal. Those two orders must agree for a batched limit, where the child's call
  for batch 2 falls between the slice of batch 1 and the slice of batch 2.

If Task 4 or 5 finds a better rule, the C++ side to change is `RegionSink::produced_by`,
`NodeSession::slice_handle` and `NodeSession::time_export` — nothing else depends on it.

### The export region needed a seam

The IPC export lives in `gpu_executor.cpp` (arrow/IPC), the region machinery in
`node_session.cpp`. `NodeSession::time_export(handle, body)` is the seam: the FFI passes the
export as a `std::function`, the session opens the region around it. `body` runs exactly once
whatever the mode.

### Decisions inside the instrument

- A CUDA failure throws (`"node timing: <call>: <cuda string>"`) at region open, at region
  close and at collection. No host-only degradation: the reference dropped to host-only, and a
  device time that was never measured reads as a fast node.
- `collect_node_regions` destroys every event before it throws, so a failed collection does
  not strand the rest of the run's events.
- The per-partition NVTX range follows `set_nvtx_ranges` alone, not the sink. The reference
  guarded it on the sink as well, which made the "ranges without timing" case emit node ranges
  and no `p<k>` ranges inside them.
- `RegionSink::produced_by` is never pruned. Handles are monotonic and the sink dies with the
  session, so a stale entry cannot alias; a measured run holds one `u64` pair per handle.

### What was proven, and how

- C++ CPU tier: `scripts/docker-build.sh --no-image --cache-dir /build/peacock -- ctest
  --test-dir cpp/build -L cpu` — 12 cases, 0 failures (master has 11; `NodeTiming.
  TheAbiRefusesAModeItDoesNotName` is new).
- shad-gpu, every gtest binary: cpu 12, gpu 3, plan 35, tpch 4, tpchv 4 — all pass.
- `cargo build -p peacockdb-ffi` inside the container: clean, no warnings.
- Red-green was watched for the three behaviours that are new rather than ported: the ABI's
  refusal of an unnamed mode, the export region, and the scatter's per-partition regions. Each
  mutation reddened exactly its own case and left the other seven green.

### Traps this dispatch walked into

- **The worktree had no `third_party/cudf`.** `git submodule status` showed `-43505bb…`; every
  cmake configure died on `rapids_config.cmake`. `git submodule update --init third_party/cudf`
  fixes it and costs one clone. A fresh chain worktree will need it again.
- **`cpp/build26` is the native build dir, not the container's.** Inside the container
  `/build/peacock/cpp-build` is bind-mounted at `cpp/build`, and the binaries there link cuDF
  from the container's conda prefix, so they do not run on the host at all.
- **`PCK_TEST_FILTER` does not reach the gtests** — `build-test-shadgpu.sh` forwards it to the
  rust binaries only. Filtering a C++ suite takes `--gtest_filter` on the binary.
- **`--run` fails while the rust core does not compile**: the gate reports "no rust test
  binaries found in cpp/install/rust-tests — every rust GPU test vanished" and exits 1. Until
  Task 3 lands, use `--push-binaries --patch` and run the gtest binaries over ssh with
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$REMOTE_REPO/cpp/install/lib:/usr/local/cuda-12.5/compat:/home/info/glibc-2.39/lib:$HOME/miniforge3/envs/rapids-cuda-12.2/lib`
  per command.

### State left for the coordinator

No new or deleted files — eight modified, all tracked. `cpp/src/operators/**`,
`cpp/src/expr.cpp`, `Cargo.toml`, `peacockdb-core/build.rs` and `.gitignore` were restored to
master byte for byte; `Cargo.toml`'s `[profile.benchmarks]` and `build.rs`'s
`PEACOCK_BUILD_PROFILE`/`PEACOCK_BUILD_OPT_LEVEL` are therefore gone, which Task 6 must not
put back — `assert!(!cfg!(debug_assertions))` is what the spec puts in their place.

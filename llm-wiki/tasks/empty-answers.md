# Answering with nothing: the table no call can build

Two refusals, one wall. A node owes rows it did not receive, and every entry point on the surface
loads a table by reading one — so there is no call to make.

- [#173](../tickets.md#t173) — a collapse of no handles, a merge of no runs, and a finish whose
  probe produced no keys.
- [#175](../tickets.md#t175) — a join whose build side produced no batch, where `Right`, `Full` and
  `RightAnti` owe their probe side. #175 says it itself: *"the same wall as #173, reached from the
  join instead of the accumulator."*

**Both close here.** They are one task because they are one missing capability seen from two nodes,
and separating them would mean building it twice.

**Depends on [`wire-schema.md`](wire-schema.md), and that dependency is the whole reason this is
small.** Both tickets say "unfreezing buys a make-empty-of-schema call and the refusals go", written
when nothing on the wire carried a bp node's schema. Once `PlanNode.output_schema` is populated, the
call is not needed at all: `execute_node` already holds the node
(`node_session.cpp:190`), so it can answer with an empty table rather than throw. **No new ABI
symbol.** The C++ said so before either of us did — `node_session.cpp:257`:

> *"A collapse of nothing has no schema to answer with: **the node's own `output_schema` is absent on
> a recipe plan**, and concatenating no views gives a table of no columns, which is not a batch
> anything above can read."*

## 1. #173 — an empty table of the declared schema

Three sites refuse, and all three want the same thing:

| site | what owes rows |
|---|---|
| `cpp/src/node_session.cpp:261-266` | a collapse with no input handles |
| `gpu_backend/accumulate.rs:331` | a merge of no runs — "the collapse of nothing under another name" |
| `gpu_backend/join.rs:236` | a finish whose probe was empty, so it has no keys to join against |

In `execute_node`, build the answer from `node->output_schema()`: one `cudf::make_empty_column` per
field (`cudf/column/column_factories.hpp:43`), assembled into a table with the declared names. The
two Rust refusals then stop being refusals — the call they could not make is a call that now
answers.

**The global aggregate is the exception and must stay one.** #173: *"a global aggregate owes its
identity row whatever arrived"* — `count` is 0, not absent. An empty-of-schema answer there would
drop a row DataFusion produces, so the aggregate arm keeps its own path and this task must not
collapse the two into "empty input, empty output".

**The CPU backend already emits nothing in the same places**, deliberately, so the two engines agree.
Check each site against its CPU counterpart as it changes: the point is not that the device stops
refusing, it is that both engines answer the same thing.

## 2. #175 — the probe side, padded or not

`empty_build_answers_nothing` (`nodes/join.rs:563`) is already the right decision in the right place;
what is missing is what to do when it returns false. Its own doc names the split:

> *"what they owe is the probe side, **padded or not**"*

- **`RightAnti` owes the probe side unpadded.** Its output is the probe columns alone, and an empty
  build side makes every probe row unmatched — so the answer *is* the probe batch. **Route it, do
  not call.** No pad, no kernel, no handle beyond the one the driver holds.
- **`Right` and `Full` owe it padded**, with typed NULLs in the build columns. That is the mirror of
  the pad that already exists: `ProjectRole::NullPad { nulls }` with `pad_project` and
  `padded_columns` (`recipe/join.rs:114`, `:261`, `:423`) appends one NULL per **probe** column a
  build-preserving join's projection keeps. This needs the same shape counting **build** columns.

So the recipe gains one role, not a mechanism. Whether that is a second `ProjectRole` variant or a
side on the existing one is the author's call — but the name must say which side is being padded,
since a reader who assumes the existing direction gets a plan that type-checks and pads the wrong
columns.

**Two corpus queries are waiting on it**, both found by T19: `tpch/q21` at `bp-tp4-single`, and
`tpcds/q77`, whose `Right` outer at four lanes gets no build side. q77 is currently out of the
end-to-end list with `tpch/q2` carrying its claim, because writing the CPU pad alone would make the
oracle answer a query the device refuses. **Put q77 back on that list as part of this**, or the
reason it was removed outlives the reason.

## 3. Tests

### Unit, Rust

- **the empty-build decision by type** — `empty_build_answers_nothing` returns true for the six that
  end the lane and false for `Right`, `Full`, `RightAnti`. It exists; assert it names all nine so a
  tenth type cannot be added silently.
- **`RightAnti` routes rather than calls** — a lane with an empty build side and a probe batch emits
  that batch and makes no ABI call. The absence of the call is the assertion, not the rows.
- **the build-side pad counts build columns** — the mirror of
  `the_pad_project_appends_one_null_per_probe_column_the_projection_keeps`, written the same way and
  next to it, so the two directions are read together. A projection keeping no build column pads
  nothing.
- **a pad in the wrong direction is caught** — assert the emitted NULL count against a join whose
  build and probe widths **differ**. With equal widths both directions pass, which is how this ships
  wrong.

### Unit, gtest

- **a collapse of no handles answers an empty table of the declared schema** — column count, names
  and types from `output_schema`, zero rows. The test that pins the fix.
- **the types are the declared ones, not defaults** — a schema with a `Decimal128(15,2)` and a
  string, asserting both come back as themselves. An empty table of the wrong types is the failure
  this cannot afford, since nothing downstream has rows to notice with.
- **a global aggregate with no input still emits its identity row** — the exception, asserted rather
  than assumed, because the natural implementation of everything above deletes it.

### Recipe walk

- **a query with an empty lane runs end to end** — the existing harness with a shape that leaves one
  lane with no build side, driven at `target_partitions` > 1. Today it refuses; this is the first
  test where an empty lane reaches the unload.

## 4. Goldens and the device workflow

| golden | moves | why |
|---|---|---|
| `bp-*.plans.txt` | **yes**, where a Right/Full join gains a pad | a new recipe call renders in the node's recipe line |
| `bp-recipe-payloads.txt` | **yes** | the pad project is a payload |
| `testdata/cost-registry.csv` | **yes** | cells move off #173 and #175 |
| `<mode>-<tier>.cpu.txt`, `.cost.txt` | **yes**, for the queries that newly run | new sections, not changed ones |

Device work, in batches of about five on `shad-gpu` with `build-test-shadgpu.sh`, as T19 does: the
two known sightings first, then any cell whose ticket names #173 or #175. Expect the freed cells to
land on whatever refuses next rather than going green — the causes are ordered, and since `casts.md`
and `wire-schema.md` closed #183 and #187, what sits in front of most of the corpus is
[#185](bp-tickets.md#t185) and [#195](bp-tickets.md#t195), which hold 60 of the 63 device cells still
disabled. **Close #173 and #175 when their cells are gone from the registry**, not when the code
lands.

The registry is a smaller worklist than this spec assumed: no row cites #173 and two cite #175. #173
is reached from the accumulator and the collapse rather than from a disabled cell, so its proof is
the gtest and the recipe-walk case rather than a rollout.

## 5. Out of scope

The other frozen-surface refusals. This task buys exactly two capabilities — an empty table of a
declared schema, and a probe side passed through padded or bare — and every other "the surface
cannot express this" stays where it is. If a third refusal looks like it would fall out for free,
that is a ticket, not an addition.
